    323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
    You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.
    Return the number of connected components in the graph.

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
    Output: 2

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
    Output: 1
