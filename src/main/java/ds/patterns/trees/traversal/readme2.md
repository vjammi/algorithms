Trees Pattern #1: Binary Tree Traversal Problems.
Unlike the previous tree patterns (given a particular tree, find a path that optimizes some criteria), we are not looking here for an optimal solution of any sort. 
Here we will be exploring all the nodes within a tree, generally in some unique way other than preorder, inorder and postorder traversal.

1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
   Find the largest value in each Tree Row 
   Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
   
2. Populating Next right pointers in each node

3. Constructing Binary Tree from Preorder/Inorder Traversals
