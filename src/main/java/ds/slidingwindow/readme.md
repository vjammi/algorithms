Sliding Windows

Used within an iterable / Sequential data structures such as an array or String 

Problems can be solved naively using quadratic time complexity   
But sliding window reduces the time complexity to linear time.  
You have a window over a section of an array, and you slide the window from start to the end. 
As you do that you change the size of the window.

Problems
1. Minimum Size SubArray Sum
2. Longest SubArray without Repeating Characters
3. Find All Anagrams in a String
